# lapiexplore

A Max4Live JavaScript API helper

## Usage

See howtouse.js

lapiexplore's goal is to be straight forward, so instead of a whole documentation, I'll just provide some examples

## Development

Pull requests are more than welcome. For local development, you'll need npm and grunt-cli. After that it's as easy as running `npm install` and you're good to go.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to run `grunt` and check that JSHint doesn't complain about anything.

That's all, folks!
